## Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CodeMapper: Bridging Code Understanding for AI and Human Analysis
> Install: `pip install codemapper`

CodeMapper is a powerful Python tool that transforms complex codebases into navigable, single-file Markdown artifacts, with a unique ability to bootstrap AI chat prompts for code analysis. Designed with both AI engineers and hobbyist developers in mind, it serves as a bridge between traditional code exploration and modern AI-assisted development workflows. Whether you're training large language models, conducting interactive AI-assisted code reviews, or simply trying to understand a new project, CodeMapper provides a unified, accessible view of your codebase that's optimized for both human readability and AI consumption.

## Key Features

- **Unified Code Visualization**: Automatically generates a comprehensive Markdown representation of your entire codebase, including:
  - Complete directory structure visualization
  - Syntax-highlighted code content
  - Intelligent file categorization
  - Documentation aggregation

- **AI Integration Optimizations**:
  - Structured output format ideal for LLM training and analysis
  - Consistent formatting for improved token efficiency
  - Built-in support for common documentation patterns
  - Metadata preservation for enhanced context

- **Git-Aware Processing**:
  - Respects `.gitignore` rules by default
  - Direct GitHub repository URL support
  - Handles large repositories efficiently
  - Smart binary file detection

- **Documentation Focus**:
  - Dedicated DocMap generation for documentation-heavy projects
  - README file prioritization
  - Support for multiple documentation directory conventions
  - Markdown-native output for universal compatibility

## AI Chat Integration

CodeMapper excels at bootstrapping AI chat interactions for code analysis. When you need to understand, debug, or enhance your code with AI assistance:

1. Generate a codemap of your project
2. Copy the generated markdown into your AI chat
3. Start asking detailed questions about your codebase

The AI assistant receives:

- Complete project structure
- All file contents with proper syntax highlighting
- Documentation in context
- Clear navigation structure

This enables the AI to provide more accurate, contextual responses about your code without manual file copying or context limitations.

## Use Cases

### For AI Engineers

- **AI Chat Prompt Bootstrapping**: Instantly generate context-rich prompts for AI chat interactions about your code
- **Interactive Code Analysis**: Seamlessly feed comprehensive codebase context to AI assistants
- **Training Data Preparation**: Generate consistently formatted codebase representations for model training
- **Documentation Generation**: Train models on well-structured documentation patterns
- **Code Understanding**: Feed entire codebases to LLMs for comprehensive analysis

Example AI Chat Workflow:

```bash
# Generate a codemap for your project
codemapper /path/to/project

# The generated codemap can be directly used in AI chat prompts:
"Here's my project structure and code, help me understand the dependency flow:
[paste _codemap.md content]"
```

### For Hobbyists

- **Project Exploration**: Quickly understand new codebases without complex IDE setup
- **Documentation Creation**: Generate comprehensive project documentation automatically
- **Code Reviews**: Facilitate easier code reviews with a unified view
- **Learning Tool**: Study and understand how different projects are structured

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install codemapper

# Basic usage
codemapper /path/to/project

# Generate documentation map
codemapper --docs /path/to/project

# Process GitHub repository
codemapper https://github.com/username/repo
```

## Example Output

CodeMapper generates two main types of outputs:

1. **CodeMap** (`project_codemap.md`):
   - Complete directory tree
   - File contents with syntax highlighting
   - Smart handling of binary and large files
   - Navigation-optimized structure

2. **DocMap** (`project_docmap.md`):
   - Documentation-focused view
   - README files
   - Documentation directory contents
   - Structured for easy consumption

## Future Development

CodeMapper is actively developing focused on:

[ToDos](docs/todo.md)

- Expanded format support (JSON, YAML, reStructuredText)
- Enhanced AI integration capabilities
- Real-time code change tracking
- Collaborative annotation features
- Intelligent code pattern recognition
- API access for programmatic integration

## Target Audiences

### AI Engineers Will Appreciate

- Consistent, clean output format for training data
- Efficient handling of large repositories
- Structured metadata preservation
- Integration-ready design

### Hobbyists Will Value

- Simple, straightforward installation
- Clear, readable output
- No complex configuration required
- Immediate utility for project understanding

## Installation Options
